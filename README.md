Each method ( Slim-View, Slim-View WW and PrivSyn) was evaluated using our datasets and workloads (code in src/script/count_query_eval_privsyn.py).
Datasets used in this experiment : 

  1- Name: Adult, dimensions: 15, number of rows: 48.000
  
  2- Name: Electricity, dimensions: 8, number of rows: 45.000
  
  3- Name: Bitcoin, dimensions: 9, number of rows: 2.916.697
  
For the sake of this comparison we generated 6 workloads each containing 100 random range queries from 2 to 6 dimensions applied to all datasets.
For each of these workloads, we created the corresponding dataset and passed it (workload + tensor) to each method (Slim-View, Slim-View WW and PrivSyn)  for evaluation. Each evaluation was repeated 10 times, and we utilized the same hyperparameters for SLIM-View as presented in the paper ($ùëéùëôùëôùëúùëê_{prop} = 0.5,sample_{prop} = 0.25$ and $\lambda = 0.05 $). For both methods, we set the epsilon value to $\epsilon = 0.1$.

In the figure above, we show a comparison of our proposed method SLIM-View with PrivSyn.
Based on the results depicted in the figure, our solution consistently outperforms PrivSyn by a significant margin in all conducted tests. This indicates that PrivSyn, much like PrivBayes, struggles to generate high-quality synthetic data when the input data is pre-aggregated into a count-tensor. This count-tensor possesses a specific attribute 'Measure' that captures the count of aggregated data, and the count queries on this data are performed based on this attribute: select sum(Measure) where Range.

In addition to the difficulty of preserving the utility,to ensure space efficiency the size of the data generated by PrivSyn should be reduced; which will reduce the utility more. Contrary to SLIM-View, which guarantees both utility and space efficiency.
